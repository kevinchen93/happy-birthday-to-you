# Happy Birthday to You

Welcome! 

The purpose of the first stage of this project is to build a website that will play a happy birthday song to the BTB member visiting *- testing merge conflict -* the site if it is his *- merge conflict resolved -* birthday. The site should not find out who the person is by them entering their birthday.

## Pre-Project Thoughts

At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chrome Dev Tools, and Git skills. 

The end goal is to build a website that allows anyone in the world to add new birthdays and names.
